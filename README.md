## Hi there 👋🏻🧡

I’m Ariel Salminen, a [Design Systems Architect](https://arielsalminen.com/) with 20+ years of experience helping companies build tools for the web platform. As an architect, I collaborate with design, product and engineering teams on the tactical and strategic direction of a design system and helps my clients set up the right tooling, processes and teams — all the way down to designing and developing complete design system platforms for them.
